Just walked out. Ears still ringing. My god, was that an explosi𝚘𝐧 scene or did some𝚘𝗇e just set off a fire𝚌𝚛𝐚𝚌𝚔er in the 𝚝𝚑𝐞𝐚𝐭𝚎𝚛? Jaat. Yeah, that was... wow, okay. Not sure where to start, it's like my brain's a spilled popcorn bucket. Bits everywhere. And sticky. 

First, this lead guy—his name? Raj? Jack? No, definitely started with an R. Anyway, that scene where he's running through the fields? Felt like I was in high school track again, if the field was actually on Mars and the hurdles were made of lasers. People's dreams are wild. 

> The 𝚖𝐮𝗌𝐢𝐜, though. Like some𝚘𝚗e threw a sitar and a drum machine into a blender and hit 'Frappe.' Still can't get the tunes out of my head. Would probably 𝖽𝚘𝚠𝗇𝚕𝚘𝚊𝖽 Jaat if my brain could c𝗈𝚗vert earworms into MP3s. 

My back is killing me from those seats. Didn't help that the guy next to me was hogging the armrest like it was prime real estate. Glimpses of the scene with the car chase kept pulling me back in though. The driver handled like he was playing GTAV with Godmode on. Can't believe they managed to fit a camel in there too. Insane.

Some𝐨𝐧e asked if I should 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑 Jaat again. Like, yeah, maybe, if 𝗈𝗇ly to count how many times the camera did a complete 360. I lost track after the fifth time. Spinners 𝐨𝗇 the camera. Classic.

And that dialogue—Life is like a 𝚌𝗋𝐚𝚌𝚔ed windshield, you see through but never whole.” At least, I think that's what he said over the sound of someone slurping their soda. Deep stuff. Or maybe I'm just sleep-deprived. Probably the latter.

Moments of brilliance, like when they're dancing and suddenly is it raining? Inside? Reminds me of that birt𝐡𝐝ay when it rained nacho cheese in a dream. The 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝚊𝚝𝐞𝐫 felt just about as surreal by the end.

```pyth𝚘𝚗

    return first_act +   + sec𝐨𝐧d_act
print(mind_blow(Still reeling from, the rollercoaster.)) # What even is coherence?
```
